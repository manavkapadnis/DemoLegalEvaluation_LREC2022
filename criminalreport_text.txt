This Criminal Appeal is filed by the _ sole\naccused, aggrieved by the judgment dated 22.04.2008\npassed in Criminal Appeal No.706-SB of 1999 passed by\nthe High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh.\n\n2. The appellant herein was convicted for the\noffence punishable under Section 18 of Narcotic Drugs\n\nand Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (for. short\n\n \n\n‘NDPS’~ Act, 1985’), vide the judgment dated\n\n20.05.1999, passed by the Special Judge, Ferozepur,\n\x0cCri.Appeal No.512 of 2009 2\n\nfor offence under Section 18 of NDPS, 1985 and was\nsentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a\nperiod of 10 years and to pay a fine of Rs.\n1,00,000/-(Rupees One Lakh) in default of payment of\nthe same, to undergo rigorous imprisonment for\nanother period of one year.\n\n3. The case of the prosecution, in brief, is that\non 12.09.1996, Devi Lal, HC (PW-1), Darbara Singh,\nS.I.(PW-2), along with other police officials were\ngoing from Dalbir Khera towards Waryam Khera, in a\nprivate jeep, on patrol duty, and when they\nreached near the’ bridge of Canal minor, the\nappellant-accused was seen coming from the opposite\ndirection, carrying a bag in his right hand. On\nseeing the police party, the appellant-accused turned\ntowards the Southern bank of the canal, but was\napprehended on suspicion. The search of the bag,\ncarried by the accused, in the presence of ASP,\nAbohar, who was called to the spot, in accordance\nwith the provisions of the law, resulted into\nrecovery of 1 kg 750 grams of opium. Upon seizure, 2\n\nsamples of 10 grams each, were separated and the\n\x0cCri.Appeal No.512 of 2009 3\n\nremaining opium was put into the same bag. The\nsamples were duly sealed and taken into possession.\nThereafter, Ruqa was sent to the police station, on\nthe basis whereof an FIR was registered. The accused\nwas arrested and after completion of the\ninvestigation, he was. challaned. On appearance\nin the court, the documents relied upon by _ the\nprosecution were supplied to the accused. A\ncharge under Section 18 of the Act was framed against\nhim, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed\ntrial.\n\n4. To prove the charge against the appellant on\nbehalf of the prosecution, four witnesses were\nexamined i.e Devi Lal, HC, (PW-1), Darbara Singh, SI,\n(PwW-2), SI (PW-3), and Sham Lal, Constable (PW-4).\nAfter closure of evidence, the statement of the\naccused under Section 313 of Cr.P.C. was recorded and\nhe was explained of all incriminating circumstances\nappeared against him, in the prosecution evidence. He\npleaded false implication, however, he did not lead\nany evidence in his defence. After appreciating the\n\noral and documentary evidence on record, the learned\n\x0cCri.Appeal No.512 of 2009 4\n\nSpecial Judge, Ferozepur, vide his judgment dated\n20.05.1999, in Sessions Trial No.17/1999, by\nrecording a finding that prosecution has proved the\nguilt of the accused for offence under Section 18 of\nthe Act, in keeping in his possession 1 kg 750\ngrams of opium in the area of village Dalmir  Khera,\nconvicted the appellant, he was sentenced to rigorous\nimprisonment for 10 years and to pay a fine of\nRs.1,00,000/- (Rupees One Lakh) in default, to\nundergo rigorous imprisonment for one year.\n\n5. Aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment of the Trial\nCourt, the appellant herein has filed a criminal\nappeal No. 706-SB before High Court of Punjab and\nHaryana at Chandigarh. The High Court by impugned\njudgment dated 22.04.2008, dismissed the appeal filed\nby the appellant herein and confirmed the judgment\nand order of sentence dated 20.05.1999, passed by the\nSpecial Judge, Ferozepur.\n\n6. We have heard Sri Mahabir Singh, learned senior\ncounsel appearing for the appellant assisted by\n\nMr. D.Mahesh Babu, advocate-on-record and\n\x0cCri.Appeal No.512 of 2009 5\n\nMs. Ranjeeta Rohatgi, learned counsel appearing for\nthe respondent-State.\n\n7. In this appeal, it is mainly contended by learned\nsenior counsel for the appellant that Sri Joginder\nSingh, ASI to whom Yogi Raj, SHO (PW-3) handed over\nthe case property on 13.09.1996 was not examined thus\nlink evidence was incomplete, in spite of the same\nTrial Court and High Court has committed error in\nconvicting the appellant. Further it is submitted\nthat though independent witnesses were there in the\npatrolling party, such witnesses were not examined\nand conviction was solely based on the official\nwitnesses. Further it is submitted that S.K. Asthana,\nASP who is claimed to have joined to the party by\nthe police, was not even examined and in fact he was\nnot there and opium was not recovered in his\npresence. It is also pleaded thus there is a\nviolation of provision under Section 50 of NDPS Act,\n1985.\n\n8. Learned senior counsel appearing’ for the\nappellant, to buttress his submissions, placed\n\nreliance on the following judgments:\n\x0cCri.Appeal No.512 of 2009 6\n\nOBWNrR\n\n(1) Trimukh Maroti Kirkan v. State of\nMaharashtra’.\n\n(1i) Noor Aga v. State of Punjab & Anr?.\n\n(1ii) Mohan Lal v. State of Punjab’.\n9. On the other hand, learned counsel for the\nrespondent-state has submitted that the prosecution\nhas proved the case by leading cogent evidence, which\nproved guilt of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt\nand there are no grounds to interfere with the same.\nLearned counsel has submitted that merely because\nprosecution has not examined any independent witness,\nsame would not necessarily lead to the conclusion\nthat the appellant has been falsely implicated. He\nplaced reliance on the judgment in the case of\nJarnail Singh v. State of Punjab*. Further recent\njudgment of this Court in the case of Varinder Kumar\nv. State of Himachal Pradesh’, is also relied on\nwherein this Court has held that all pending criminal\n\nprosecutions, trials and appeals prior to the law led\n\n(2006) 10 SCC 681\n(2008)16 SCC 417\n(2018)17 SCC 627.\n(2011)3 SCC 521.\n(2019) SCC Online SC 170\n\x0cCri.Appeal No.512 of 2009 7\n\ndown in Mohan Lal?, shall continue to be governed by\nthe individual facts of the case.\n\n10. According to learned senior counsel for the\nappellant, Joginder Singh, ASI to whom Yogi Raj, SHO\n(PW-3) handed over the case property for producing\nthe same before the JIllaqa Magistrate and_ who\nreturned the same to him after such production was\nnot examined, as such, link evidence was incomplete.\nIn this regard, it is to be noticed that Yogi Raj\nSHO handed over the case property to  Joginder\nSingh, ASI, for production before the Court. After\nproducing the case property before the Court, he\nreturned the case property to Yogi Raj, SHO (PW-3)\nwith the seals intact. It is also to be noticed\nthat Joginder Singh, ASI was not in possession of\nseals of either of the investigating officer or of\nYogi Raj, SHO. He produced the case property before\nthe Court on 13.09.1996 vide application Ex.P-13,\nthe concerned Judicial Magistrate of First Class,\nafter verifying the seals on the case property,\npassed the order Ex.P-14 to the effect that since\n\nthere was no judicial malkhana at Abohar, the case\n\x0cCri.Appeal No.512 of 2009 8\n\nproperty was ordered to be kept in safe custody, in\nPolice Station Khuian Sarwar till further orders.\nSince Joginder Singh, ASI was not in possession\nof the seals of either of the SHO or of the\nInvestigating Officer, the question of tampering\nwith the case property by him did not arise at all.\n11. Further he has returned the case property, after\nproduction of the same, before the Illaqa Magistrate,\nwith the seals intact, to Yogi Raj, SHO. In that view\nof the matter, the Trial Court and the High Court\nhave rightly held that non-examination of Joginder\nSingh, did not, in any way, affect the case of\nprosecution. Further, it is evident from_ the\nreport of the Chemical Examiner, Ex.P-10, that the\nsample was received with seals intact and that the\nseals on the sample, tallied with the sample seals.\nIn that view of the matter, the chain of evidence was\ncomplete.\n\n12. The next contention of learned senior counsel Sri\nMahabir Singh is that the ASP, who was\nsummoned to the spot, in whose presence search and\n\nrecovery was effected, was not examined.\n\x0cCri.Appeal No.512 of 2009 9\n\nAs such, it is submitted that the non-examination of\nASP is fatal to the case of prosecution and it is in\nviolation of Section 50 of NDPS Act, 1985.\n\n13. It is the specific case of the prosecution that\non 12.09.1996, Darbara Singh, SI, (PW-2) along with\nother police officials were going from Dalbir Khera-2\ntowards Waryam Khera in a private jeep, when they\nreached near the bridge of Canal Minor,’ the\nappellant-accused was seen coming from opposite\ndirection carrying a bag. It is alleged that on\nseeing the police party, he turned towards’ the\nSouthern bank of the canal but was apprehended on\nsuspicion. It is specifically pleaded that the ASP,\nAbhor who was called at the spot and in his presence\nhis bag was searched which resulted into recovery of\n1 kg 750 grams of opium. The Trial Court as well as\nthe High Court, has recorded a finding that the\nperusal of the record reveals the ASP~ was\nsummoned number of times but either service was not\neffected or as and when he was served, he sent a\nrequest for exemption from personal attendance\n\nstating valid reasons. Further, it appears that the\n\x0cCri.Appeal No.512 of 2009 10\n\nHigh Court has issued directions to the Trial Court\nto decide the case before 30.04.1999. As much as S.K.\nAsthana, ASP was not examined by 30.04.1999, a\nrequest for an extension was sought by the Special\nJudge, Ferozepur and it was adjourned to 17.05.1999.\nEven by 17.05.1999, the ASP could not be served as he\nwas on leave. In view of such reasoning assigned by\nthe Trial Court, as well as the High Court, merely\nbecause S.K. Asthana, ASP was not examined, it\ncannot be said that prosecution has failed to prove\nits case. It is clear from the evidence on record\nthat he was summoned at the time of search and\nseizure and only in his’ presence search was\nconducted, as such, there is no violation of Section\n50 of the NDPS Act.\n\n14. Further, it is contended by learned senior\ncounsel appearing for the appellant that no\nindependent witness was examined, despite\nthe fact they were available. In this regard, it is\nto be noticed from the depositions of Devi Lal, Head\nConstable (PW-1), during the course of cross-\n\nexamination, has stated that efforts were made to\n\x0cCri.Appeal No.512 of 2009 11\n\n6\n\njoin independent witnesses, but none were available.\nThe mere fact that the case of the prosecution is\nbased on the evidence of official witnesses, does not\nmean that same should not be believed.\n15. The judgment in the case of Jarnail Singh v.\nState of Punjab*, relied on by the counsel for the\nrespondent-State also supports the case of the\nprosecution. In the aforesaid judgment, this Court\nhas held that merely because prosecution did not\nexamine any independent witness, would not\nnecessarily lead to conclusion that accused was\nfalsely implicated. The evidence’ of official\nwitnesses cannot be distrusted and disbelieved,\nmerely on account of their official status. In the\ncase of State, Govt. of NCT of Delhi v. Sunil & Anr.®\nit was held as under:\n“Tt is an archaic’ notion that\n\nactions of the Police Officer, should be\n\napproached with initial distrust. It is\n\ntime now to start placing at least\n\ninitial trust on the actions and the\n\ndocuments made by the Police. At any\n\nrate, the Courts cannot start with the\n\npresumption that the police records are\n\nuntrustworthy. AS a presumption of law,\nthe presumption would be the other way\n\n(2001)1 SCC 652\n\x0cCri.Appeal No.512 of 2009 12\n\nround. The official acts of the Police\n\nhave been regularly performed is a wise\n\nprinciple of presumption and recognized\n\neven by the Legislature”.\n16. Learned counsel also placed reliance on the\njudgment of this Court in the case of Mohan Lal? to\nsupport his argument that informant and investigator\ncannot be the same person. But in the subsequent\njudgment, in the case of Varinder Kumar® this Court\nheld that all pending criminal prosecutions, trials\nand appeals prior to law laid down in Mohan Lal?,\nshall continue to be governed by individual facts of\nthe case.\n17. Having regard to oral and documentary evidence\nplaced on record, we are in agreement with the\nfindings recorded by the Trial Court and High Court.\nFrom the evidence on record in this case the\nprosecution has proved the guilt of the appellant\nbeyond reasonable doubt. The conviction recorded and\nthe sentence imposed is in conformity with the\nprovisions of law and evidence on record, thus no\n\ninterference is called for. Accordingly, this appeal\n\nis devoid of merits, and the same is dismissed.\n\x0cCri.Appeal No.512 of 2009 13\n\n18. As the appellant-accused is on bail, the bail\nbonds are cancelled. He shall surrender within a\nperiod of four weeks from today, to serve remaining\nperiod of sentence, failing which, the Chief Judicial\nMagistrate, shall take necessary steps to take the\n\nappellant into custody to serve remaining period of\n\nsentence.\nSees J.\n[N.V.
